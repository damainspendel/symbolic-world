# JungKG — product backlog

Ideas parked for later, not yet scheduled. The canonical graph and its § discipline
always come first; nothing here may compromise the trust model (every canonical edge
§-anchored + independently verified).

## App

- **Explore node card collides with the bottom control bar.** The selected-node card
  (bottom of Explore) overlaps the floating Mode / search / settings pill — they sit on
  top of each other. Fix: lift the card above the control bar (bottom inset), or dock the
  card to a side, so the two never overlap. *(Added 2026-07-23.)*

- **Reference toolbar title ("Around §N") leaks into Explore.** Because both views are
  kept alive (so Explore keeps its layout), the Reference NavigationSplitView's window
  toolbar/title still shows in Explore mode, where it's meaningless. Fix: suppress the
  reference chrome (title + sidebar toggle) when `mode == .explore`, or give Explore its
  own toolbar context. *(Added 2026-07-23.)*

- **Bidirectional selection (Reference → Explore).** Selecting a claim/node in Reference
  should highlight — and centre — the corresponding node/edge in the Explore graph.
  Selection currently flows only Explore → Reference; make it symmetric so switching to
  Explore lands on (and highlights) what you were reading. *(Added 2026-07-23.)*

- **App icon — Tenets-family style.** Design a Red Thread app icon consistent with the
  Tenets app family's visual identity ⚠ *(match the real suite's icon language — corner
  radius, palette, motif treatment)*. Motif candidates: a red thread / Ariadne's thread,
  a labyrinth, or a single luminous node-and-edge. macOS + iOS sizes.

## Features

- **User-contributed amplifications.** Let people add their own amplifications — the
  images and parallels *they* see around a symbol. **Hard constraint:** these live in a
  **separate, clearly-labeled layer**, visually and structurally distinct from Jung's
  §-anchored amplifications; they never merge into the verified graph or borrow its
  authority. Optional: let a user cite their own source. Serves Theo (correspondence
  practitioner) and Dana (dreamer) especially. *(Added 2026-07-23.)*

- **Local-only note option.** A per-note "do not sync" toggle for the most sensitive
  material (Marisol's clinical case notes) — overrides CloudKit sync for that note.

- **Note export formats beyond Markdown.** BibTeX / formatted academic citation export
  for the scholar/analyst personas.

- **Multi-edition §→page concordances.** Ship Bollingen first; add other printings /
  the Gesammelte Werke so "open the paragraph" works for more owned editions.

- **Stable citable URLs (web app).** Permalink per node and per edge, for scholars who
  cite and share (Whitmore).

- **Tradition-first reverse index.** Browse the graph by tradition (Kabbalah, Gnostic,
  alchemy, Christian mysticism) rather than by psychological concept (Theo).

- **Explore mode inside the app chrome.** The dark constellation view as a mode within
  the reading companion, not just the standalone atlas.

## Verification architecture: make it declaratively manageable (added 2026-07-27)

Today the verification stack (structure gate, voice specialist, sweeps, seeded
calibrations) lives as prompt text inside orchestration calls — it works, but
it is not inspectable or tunable as a *thing*. Backlog: a small declarative layer.

- `pipeline/verifiers.yaml` — one entry per verifier stage: name, model, axis
  (structure | voice | ...), prompt template (file ref), output schema, and its
  calibration set + last measured sensitivity/specificity. Adding a specialist
  for a new corpus axis = adding a YAML block, not editing orchestration.
- `pipeline/verify.py` — single runner: takes a candidates file + stage name,
  builds the payload from the corpus, invokes the model, writes verdicts in the
  standard shape. Same runner powers production gating, sweeps, and calibrations
  (a calibration is just a run over a seeded input with a key file).
- Per-stage calibration tracked in the YAML (date, seed, scores) so "how good is
  this verifier" is data, not memory; recalibration is a one-command re-run.
- Verdict application (corrections/merge/provenance) already uniform — extract the
  apply step into `pipeline/apply_verdicts.py` so every stage shares one code path.
- Payoff: the paper's "specialist decomposition" becomes an operable pattern —
  new corpus, new axes, same machinery; and the assumptions register can link
  each verifier to its measured performance.

## Publication venues beyond arXiv (added 2026-07-27)
Research other places to publish/announce: Paradigm Explorer, Jungian journals
(e.g. Journal of Analytical Psychology, Jung Journal: Culture & Psyche,
International Journal of Jungian Studies), digital-humanities venues (DH Quarterly,
Journal of Cultural Analytics). Check each venue's stance on AI-assisted work and
preprints before submitting.

## Reader's guide to the papers we cite (added 2026-07-27)
Damian wants plain-language breakdowns of the papers cited in docs/PAPER.md to
understand the core claims — especially the hallucination-rate and KG-extraction
benchmarks (KGGen, GraphRAG accuracy studies, citation-hallucination surveys) and
which citations are preprints/non-peer-reviewed ("nonpublications") vs published.
Deliverable: one short annotated-bibliography doc, per-paper: what it measured,
how, headline number, and how much weight it can bear.

## E7: rubric-free cross-vendor replication (added 2026-07-27)
Re-run a cross-vendor audit sample WITHOUT the first-party rubric: the second vendor
states support + severity in its own terms; map post hoc. Motivated by Gemini's
prompt-bias critique (shared-rubric convergence). See docs/experiments/exp6_crossvendor.md.

## Hostile-review remediations (added 2026-07-27, from Gemini Reviewer-2 pass)
Priority order agreed with the hostile review's own "what would change my mind":
1. **Expand calibration sets** — seeded corruptions from n=5/class to n=25/class (~$5-8):
   turns fractions into rates with usable confidence intervals. Do before arXiv.
2. **Human ground-truth tier** — upgrade the community pilot ambition toward ~200
   human-annotated paragraphs; this is the answer to the (correct) circularity attack:
   AI extracts, AI verifies, AI audits — the buck must stop at humans.
3. **Public-domain mini-replication** — run the identical pipeline on a public-domain
   interpretive corpus (e.g. William James, Varieties of Religious Experience, 1902):
   answers generalizability AND gives a fully distributable reproduction package.
4. **Paragraph-hash verification pack** — publish letter-normalized hashes of all
   cited paragraphs so third parties with any edition can verify quote anchoring
   without us distributing copyrighted text.
5. ~~Semantic-diffusion terminology~~ ✅ repositioned as shorthand w/ decomposition-literature context.

- Review great-mother vs the-mother node split (b-union-1 §403 edge may want retargeting to the new the-mother figure node; decided 2026-07-27 when both gates rejected the convention on b-cw12-4 n9)
